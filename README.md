# Mergesort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) and in-place version of mergesort.
Use the template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've
provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`.

Hint: To make merge sort in-place, think about what happens during the merge --
where are elements moved to and from? To make it iterative, think about the
part of the array each recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

The outer loop doubles each time it goes through so it would run at O(logn) times. The inner loop would run at O(n) times. Finally the merge step would worst case run at O(n^2). This makes it O(n^2 * nlogn). So it runs at $O(n^3logn)$.

code copied from what i wrote last semester. The TA helped me find my mistake in the runtime.
